I was tasked with redesigning the Visual Design and User Experience for nibib.nih.gov, and here I'll focus on the homepage, and one particular user group (Research Scientists looking for funding, referred to as UG.A from here). The site is highly complex. I identified 6 stakeholder groups, each with varying influences and interests.

I interviewed and assessed each of these groups. I used their institutional knowledge to get an initial handle on who the users are. Using this information, combined with Google analytics (I looked at common user flow patterns and matched them up with domain, OS, and other captured demographic information) and further research and thought, I came up with 6 user groups. I then set about finding users in each of those groups, conducting a variety of interviews and tests with them, both in person and remotely.

In the interviews and through the analytics analyzation it was apparent that UG.A has a major issue with finding applicable grant funding opportunities. The flow was Home -> Funding -> Funding Opportunities: Search -> Individual Opportunity (external link). This is at least 4 clicks and possibly more. In my interviews some comments were "I don't know where to search" and "Why is the search hidden..." When given a task to find an applicable grant funding opportunity the researchers had only a 60% success rate with an average completion time of 92 seconds.

To cut this for brevity, I recommended a two stage solution: First, without redesigning the whole site, we would change Funding to Funding Opportunities, and float the search up a level to the portal page. Second, on the new design, we would have a search on the homepage specifically for funding opportunities. One other thing that came out of the interviews was that no researcher was looking for more than one type of grant (we have three categories of grant opps). In light of this I recommended changing the list of funding opps on the homepage to quick links to a filtered list for just one category. There's more surrounding this, and I'm happy to discuss in detail any and all of the design decisions that were made (sometimes due to stakeholder requirements rather than user data sadly), but needless to say there's a reason behind all of it!
